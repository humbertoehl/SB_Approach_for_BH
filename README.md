# Entanglement Entropy Simulation for Bose-Hubbard Model

## Overview

This project is an application for simulating the entanglement entropy calculation for a Bose-Hubbard model based on a slave-bosons approach. The program, titled "SB_approach_for_EE.py", allows users to easily simulate and visualize the entanglement entropy as a function of the interaction factor (J) of the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian.

## Usage

To use this application, follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the Project**: Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. **Adjust Constants (if needed)**: Open the "SB_approach_for_EE.py" file. You can adjust the constants in the code if necessary. These constants may include parameters relevant to the Bose-Hubbard model or simulation settings.

3. **Run the Program**: Execute the "SB_approach_for_EE.py" script.

4. **OUTPUT**: Once the simulation is complete, the program will output a plot of the entanglement entropy as a function of the interaction factor (J).

## Dependencies

This project requires Python 3.x and the following Python libraries:

- numpy
- matplotlib
